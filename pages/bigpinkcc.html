    <h4>Cookie Ingredients:</h4>
  

    
    <ul>
      <div class="contents">
      <li>5 cups all purpose flour</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons baking powder</li>
      <li>1 ½ teaspoons fine sea salt</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon ground cardamom</li>
      <li>1 ½ cups (3 sticks) unsalted butter at room temperature</li>
      <li>1 ½ cups granulated sugar</li>
      <li>4 large eggs at room temperature</li>
      <li>1 ½ teaspoons pure vanilla extract</li>
      <li>1 ½ teaspoons almond extract</li>
      </div>
    </ul>
    

    <h4>Cream Cheese Frosting Ingredients:</h4>
      <div class="contents">
      <ul>
      <li>8 ounces cream cheese (softened)</li>
      <li>½ cup (1 stick) unsalted butter at room temperature</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon almond extract</li>
      <li>3 ½-4 cups powdered sugar</li>
      <li>
        ¼ cup freeze dried strawberries (crushed & sifted) or a couple of drops
        of pink or red food coloring
      </li>
      <li>¼ cup decorative sprinkles (optional)</li>
      </ul></div>

    <h4>Sugar Cookie Steps:</h4>
      <div class="contents">
        <ol>
      <li>
        Whisk together the flour, baking powder, salt, and cardamom in a medium
        bowl. Set aside.
      </li>
      <li>
        In the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the paddle attachment,
        cream the butter and sugar together on high speed for about 5 minutes,
        stopping the mixer occasionally to scrape down the sides of the bowl.
        The mixture should be airy and fluffy and slightly lighter in color.
      </li>
      <li>
        Crack the eggs into a liquid measuring cup. With the mixer on low,
        slowly add eggs to the bowl one egg at a time, allow each egg to blend
        in completely before adding the next. Blend in the vanilla extract,
        followed by the almond extract. *hint, the mixture may slightly curdle
        when you add the almond extract. Don't worry, it will recede once the
        dry ingredients are mixed in. Scrape down the sides of the bowl.
      </li>
      <li>
        Slowly add the dry ingredients and mix on low speed until a smooth
        consistency is achieved. The dough will be soft and sticky at this
        point.
      </li>
      <li>
        Divide the dough into three equal disks and wrap individually in plastic
        wrap. Chill the dough in refrigerator for at least an hour up to
        overnight. This allows the dough to develop and firm up so it's easier
        to to roll out.
      </li>
    </ol></div>

    <h4>Cream Cheese Frosting Steps:</h4>

      <div class="contents">
        <ol>
      While the dough chills, prepare the frosting. If using freeze dried
      strawberries:
      <li>
        Crush the freeze dried strawberries with a mortar and pestle, in a food
        processor or by placing them in a sealed plastic baggie and gently
        rolling and pounding them with a rolling pin. Keep crushing them until a
        fine powder is formed.
      </li>
      <li>
        Next, sift the strawberry powder through a fine mesh sieve to remove any
        large seeds.
      </li>
      <li>
        Sift the freeze dried strawberry powder together with the powder sugar.
      </li>
      <li>
        In the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the paddle attachment,
        cream the butter, cream cheese and almond extract until completely
        smooth.
      </li>
      <li>
        Slowly add in sifted powdered sugar mix to taste - use 3 ½ cups for a
        more tangy cream cheese frosting and 4 cups for a sweeter cream cheese
        frosting. Alternatively, if you are using food coloring, slowly add, one
        small drop at a time, until you are happy with the color. Blend until
        color is evenly distributed throughout the frosting. Place the frosting
        in refrigerator until ready to use.
      </li>
    </ol></div>

    <h4>Bake and Decorate:</h4>

      <div class="contents">
      <ol>
      <li>
        Preheat the oven to 350°. Remove dough from refrigerator and allow it to
        soften for a few minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Be sure to have cookie cutters and a rolling pin available. For large
        cookies, I use a 4" round and 3.5" x 4" heart shape for the large
        cookies. For the medium cookies, 3" round and 2.5" x 3" heart shape.
      </li>
      <li>
        On a lightly floured surface, use a rolling pin to roll out one of the
        dough disks into ¼" thickness.
      </li>
      <li>
        Cut the rolled dough with cookie cutters, place cookies closely on a
        lined baking sheets. Gather the scraps and re-roll and cut dough. Repeat
        with remaining dough disks. Place the baking sheet of cut cookies in the
        refrigerator or freezer to firm up for at least 15-30 minutes while the
        oven preheats. At this stage you can freeze the cut cookies solid on the
        baking sheets. Then transfer to a tight sealing baggie and store in the
        freezer up to two months.
      </li>
      <li>
        Place 6 large chilled cookies per baking sheet, at least 1" apart. Bake
        for 12-16 minutes (depending on size) until the edges start to brown
        slightly. Remove from oven and cool on cookie racks.
      </li>
      <li>
        Once the cookies have completely cooled, frost them liberally using a
        small offset spatula. Add sprinkles if desired.
      </li>
