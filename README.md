# odin-recipes
Through a simple recipe page(and my first project), this HTML project demonstrates my current knowledge and ability to integrate basic HTML coding language. Portraying my ability to use the HTML boilerplate, various headings, paragraph formats (including bold and italicized), source images, enter comments, house links (relative and absolute), and integrate ordered and unordered lists in a website. In addition I have learned how to correctly navigate my terminal and organize my directory appropriately without creating error. I have learned how to create and commit projects to my GitHub through my terminal.
