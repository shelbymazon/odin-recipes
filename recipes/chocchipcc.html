    <ol>
      <li>Preheat oven to 475°.</li>
      <li>Prepare baking sheets with parchment paper to prevent sticking.</li>
      <li>
        In the smaller mixing bowl, whisk together the flour, corn starch, salt,
        and baking soda.
      </li>
      <li>Cut the stick of butter into smaller pieces.</li>
      <li>
        In the larger mixing bowl, combine the butter, sugar, brown sugar, egg,
        and vanilla extract.
      </li>
      <li>
        Gently stir the dry ingredients (flour, corn starch, salt, etc.) into
        the larger bowl with the butter/egg/sugar mixture.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add in chocolate chips and optional walnuts. Mix gently until fully
        combined.
      </li>
      <li>
        Using a full size spoon (tablespoon), make cookie dough balls and place
        them on the baking sheet.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake for 6-7 minutes or until the tops of the cookies get golden/brown
        (keep your eye on them).
      </li>
      <li>
        Remove from the oven and let them cool. They’ll continue to cook on the
        inside while they cool.
      </li>
      <li>

        cooled.
      </li>
