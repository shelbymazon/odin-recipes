      <li>1 1/2 cup granulated sugar</li>
      <li>1/2 cup +2 tbsp canola oil - OR vegetable oil</li>
      <li>2 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
      <li>2 1/2 cup cake flour</li>
      <li>2 1/2 tsp pumpkin pie spice</li>
      <li>1 1/2 tsp baking powder</li>
      <li>1 1/2 tsp baking soda</li>
      <li>1 tsp kosher sea salt</li>
      <li>1/2 tsp cinnamon</li>
      <li>1 1/4 cup mini semi-sweet chocolate chips</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Baking Steps:</h4>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Preheat oven to 375°F (190°C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper
        or a silicone baking mat, and set aside.
      </li>
      <li>
        In a large bowl of a stand mixer (or a large mixing bowl using a hand
        mixer), add the pumpkin puree, sugar, oil, and vanilla. Mix until
        combined, about 30 seconds.
      </li>
      <li>
        In a medium mixing bowl, whisk together the flour mixture, pumpkin pie
        spice, baking powder, baking soda, salt, and cinnamon. With mixing speed
        on low, gradually add the dry ingredients. Mix until combined.
      </li>
      <li>
        Using a large spatula or wooden spoon, fold in the mini chocolate chips.
      </li>
      <li>
        Using a standard-size cookie scoop, scoop the cookie dough onto the
        prepared baking sheet. Place in the oven and bake for 14-16 minutes or
        until they are firm and start to turn brown on the edges.
      </li>
      <li>
        Remove and allow to cool for 5 minutes on the sheet before transferring
        them to a wire rack to cool completely. Do not store until cookies have
        cooled for at least 30 minutes at room temperature.
      </li>
    </ol>
